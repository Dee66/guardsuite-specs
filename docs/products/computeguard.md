# ComputeGuard (v2.0.0)

Enterprise FinOps governance, deterministic remediation, compliance ledger, and premium GuardScore inputs for GPU and compute-heavy infrastructure.


## Overview
ComputeGuard is the premium compute governance and remediation blueprint for
organizations operating GPU-heavy or cost-sensitive ML/AI workloads. It
extends ComputeScan with deterministic FixPack-Lite remediation, advanced
FinOps rule coverage, full compliance ledger generation, and GuardBoard-ready
overlays. ComputeGuard is designed for teams requiring deep visibility into
GPU usage, instance sizing, cost anomalies, and compute governance.
