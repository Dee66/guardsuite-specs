# GuardBoard (v2.0.0)

Executive-grade governance dashboard aggregating GuardScore, FixPack insights, remediation paths, compliance ledgers, and multi-pillar risk visibility.


## Overview
GuardBoard is the executive-facing governance and reporting console for the
entire GuardSuite ecosystem. It consumes deterministic outputs from VectorScan,
ComputeScan, PipelineScan, and all paid “Guard” products to produce unified
scorecards, trend analysis, remediation paths, and compliance-grade reports.
GuardBoard includes GuardScore visualization, FixPack-Lite upgrade reminders,
ledger summaries (from paid products), SVG badge distribution, and cross-pillar
correlation for attack-path-aware insights. Designed for CISO dashboards,
platform leadership, and compliance teams.
