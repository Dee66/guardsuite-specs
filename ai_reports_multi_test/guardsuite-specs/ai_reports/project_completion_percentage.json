  "notes": "Counts derived by scanning ai_reports/ for planned task IDs across Phase-3, Phase-4 and Phase-5 artifacts. Total planned tasks = sum of ATU entries, rule-seeding tasks, evaluator tasks, unblock items, and phase-5 activation step IDs. Completed tasks were marked when ai_reports contained deterministic artifacts or verification evidence (promoted schema, updated base rule, scaffolded adapters, and adapter tests + passing pytest). Remaining blockers: promote additional product schemas, complete rule seeding across products, resolve repository-wide flake8 issues, and add CI enforcement. See ai_reports/phase5_full_verification.json and ai_reports/phase5_flake8_raw_after.txt for evidence and details.",
