# Utilities Folder

This directory contains development-only helper scripts used during
repository maintenance, migration, and inspection tasks.

## list_tree.sh
A portable helper script that emits an ASCII tree view of the repository
structure. Kept here for development convenience now that Strategy-C has
finalized the authoritative folder layout under `/products`.

**Important:**  
- These utilities are not part of any product’s canonical specification.  
- No production or template logic depends on these scripts.  
- Utilities here may be added, replaced, or removed without affecting the
  GuardSuite product line.
