short_description: >
  Canonical product spec + checklist registry with deterministic bootstrap
  generation for GuardSuite.
long_description: |
  GuardSpecs stores every canonical GuardSuite product spec, checklist, and GPT
  instruction set. It validates content against the schema registry, produces
  deterministic bootstrap artifacts for Architect sessions, and exposes API/CLI
  tooling so pillars can automate validation. GuardSpecs is the control plane
  for governance rules, migration guides, and deterministic hashing policies.
purpose_summary: >
  Provide a single source of truth for GuardSuite specs, checklists, and
  bootstraps with strict schema validation and deterministic hashing.
