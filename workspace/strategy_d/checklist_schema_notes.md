# Strategy-D Phase 3 — Checklist Schema Expansion Complete

The canonical checklist schema has now been expanded to reflect all
requirements listed in the GuardSuite Master Spec.

Next Steps (Phase 4):
1. Normalize each product's checklist against this schema.
2. Identify missing sections in all existing checklists.
3. Fill required fields incrementally.
4. Prepare for auto-validation scaffolding in a future cycle.
