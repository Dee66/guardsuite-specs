Before (excerpt from products/pipelinescan/metadata/product.yml):
  - missing_provenance: allowed (scanner sets provenance_source: "scanner_unverified")

After (same excerpt after fix):
  - missing_provenance: 'allowed (scanner sets provenance_source: "scanner_unverified")'

Note: Quoted the RHS string to avoid an unquoted scalar containing an embedded double-quoted substring which caused a YAML scanner error.
