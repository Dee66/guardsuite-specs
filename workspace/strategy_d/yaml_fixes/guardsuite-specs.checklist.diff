Before (excerpt from products/guardsuite-specs/checklist/checklist.yml):
  - GET  /products
    desc: list products (paginated)
    auth: reader
  - POST /products
    desc: create product (require spec + checklist + gpt-instructions)
    auth: writer

After (same excerpt after fix):
  - path: "GET  /products"
    desc: list products (paginated)
    auth: reader
  - path: "POST /products"
    desc: create product (require spec + checklist + gpt-instructions)
    auth: writer

Note: Converted bare endpoint scalars into mappings with a quoted `path` key so the following mapping entries (`desc`, `auth`, `body`) are valid YAML members of the same sequence item.
