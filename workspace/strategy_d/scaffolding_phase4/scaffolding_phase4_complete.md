# Strategy-D Scaffolding Phase 4 — Completion Record
Timestamp: 2025-11-25T15:02:44+00:00

Phase 4 introduced the deterministic demo-mode integration specification,
including:
- canonical output rules
- canonical plan hashing rules
- expected output hash contract
- future CLI demo-mode design

No product files were modified.
No demo plans were introduced.
No schema or checklist content was changed.

This phase is now sealed.  
All future deterministic demo-mode work must proceed under Strategy-D Phase 5+.
