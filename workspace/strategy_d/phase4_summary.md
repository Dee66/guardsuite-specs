# Strategy-D Phase 4 — Checklist Gap Analysis Complete

This phase scanned every checklist/checklist.yml, compared them to the
canonical checklist schema, and produced per-product diff reports.

**Next Step — Phase 5:**
Normalize each checklist by:
- Adding missing canonical sections
- Preserving existing content
- Ensuring no required field is omitted
- Removing obsolete/non-canonical fields if safe
- Preparing products for future automated validation

No checklist content was modified in Phase 4.
