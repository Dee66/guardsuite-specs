# Strategy-D Product Schema Expansion Complete
The canonical product schema has now been expanded to fully reflect the
GuardSuite Master Spec's structure and required fields.

Next Steps (Strategy-D Phase 3):
- Expand the canonical checklist schema.
- Begin normalizing all product specs to match this canonical schema.
- Add missing product directories for future products listed in the Master Spec.
