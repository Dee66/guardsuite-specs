# Strategy-D Scaffolding Phase 3 — Completion Record
Timestamp: 2025-11-25T14:42:16+00:00
Commit: 2831a6d

Phase 3 established the design scaffolding for deterministic demo ingestion
and CLI-based reproduction workflows. No product files or schemas were touched.

## Completed in Phase 3
- Created scaffolding tree:
  - scaffolding_phase3/design/
  - scaffolding_phase3/cli_workflows/
  - scaffolding_phase3/demo_ingestion/
- Authored the following design documents:
  - phase3_overview.md
  - design/demo_ingestion_design.md
  - cli_workflows/cli_demo_flow.md

## Not Performed in Phase 3
- No ingestion logic implemented
- No demo content modified
- No product directories touched
- No CLI or snapshot code introduced

## Next Step
Phase 4 will introduce integration scaffolding for stable demo-mode execution
and deterministic hash computation.

This phase is now sealed. Any future changes require a new Strategy-D cycle.
