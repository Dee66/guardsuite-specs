# Strategy-D Phase 5 — Checklist Normalization (Preamble)

Phase 4 produced gap reports for all checklists.
Phase 5 will apply normalization edits to each checklist:

- Add missing canonical sections
- Preserve existing content verbatim
- Insert placeholder stubs where content is missing
- Ensure structure matches canonical schema
- Remove deprecated/non-canonical fields (only when safe)
- Prepare for future automated validation tooling

No product checklists have been edited yet.
