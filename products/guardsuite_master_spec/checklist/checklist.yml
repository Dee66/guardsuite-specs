# repos/guard-specs/spec.yml
# GuardSuite — guard-specs Service Specification (authoritative)
# Purpose: canonical product spec & checklist registry, schema registry,
# validation engine, deterministic bootstrap generator, and governance control plane.

metadata:
  id: guard-specs
  name: GuardSpecs
  title: GuardSuite Specs Service
  version: 1.0.0
  owner: GuardSuite Platform Team
  contact: platform@guardsuite.internal
  created: 2025-11-24
  repo_path: repos/guard-specs
  source_draft_reference: "/mnt/data/guardsuite-specs.yml" # session upload (traceability only)

mission:
  - "Be the canonical source-of-truth for product specs, checklists, and gpt-instructions across GuardSuite."
  - "Produce deterministic, validated, versioned bootstrap artifacts consumable by Architect sessions and tooling."
  - "Enforce schema-first governance, versioning discipline, and lifecycle management across the suite."

purpose:
  summary: >
    guard-specs stores product YAML specs and checklists, validates them against the schema registry,
    generates deterministic bootstrap artifacts (spec + checklist + gpt-instructions + session skeleton),
    exposes programmatic APIs and CLI for CI/Architect consumption, and manages governance and migrations.

principles:
  - "Schema-first: all public shapes live under /schemas and are versioned."
  - "Determinism: identical inputs must produce identical bootstrap artifacts."
  - "Governance: breaking changes require migration guides and downstream pinning."
  - "No secrets: specs must not contain secrets; secrets are external references."
  - "Auditability: every change must be recorded with actor, timestamp, and diff."

scope:
  responsibilities:
    - authoritative storage of product specs, checklists, and gpt-instructions
    - schema registry and schema validation service
    - deterministic bootstrap artifact generation and versioning
    - API and CLI for product lifecycle operations (create, update, validate, generate)
    - scheduler for periodic/regenerative bootstrap generation
    - webhook ingestion for Implementor #FEEDBACK_CONTRACT and CI audit results
    - governance workflows (deprecation, migration, version pinning)
    - artifact storage, metadata DB, and backup
  out_of_scope:
    - runtime execution of pillar code (concrete pillars run their own code)
    - platform network gateway and auth proxy (handled by platform/gateway)
    - secret manager storage for sensitive values (use external secret manager)

  default_output: JSON
  ux_requirements:
    - outputs must be copy-paste friendly for Architect sessions
    - error codes should conform to /schemas/cli_error.json

bootstrap_generation:
  purpose: produce deterministic JSON bootstrap artifact for Architect consumption
  artifact_shape:
    - metadata: { product_id, timestamp, version_hash, generator_version }
    - spec: raw spec_yaml
    - checklist: raw checklist_yaml
    - gpt_instructions: raw gpt_instructions_yaml
    - session_skeleton: { last_checklist_item: null, last_instruction_version: 0 }
    - validation_report: []
  algorithm:
    - load YAMLs
    - validate against schemas
    - compose canonical JSON (canonical key ordering, list sorting rules)
    - normalize environment-dependent fields (paths, runtime metadata)
    - compute version_hash: sha256(canonical_json)[0:12]
    - persist artifact to object_store and metadata DB
    - (optionally) commit artifact to repo path /bootstraps/<product>.json (configurable)
  determinism_requirements:
    - canonical serialization consistent across platforms
    - normalization: strip_absolute_paths, normalize_path_separators, remove_platform_specific_metadata
    - snapshot test: generate 3x and assert identical version_hash

validation_engine:
  features:
    - schema validation (YAML -> JSON schema)
    - cross-check spec vs checklist consistency
    - no-secrets detection (disallow common secret patterns)
    - checklist completeness: unique IDs, acceptance_criteria presence
    - naming conformance (id format rules)
    - fixpack references verification (if fixpack present)
    - master_spec invariants enforcement (e.g., determinism flags)
  output:
    - structured validation_report with severity, file/line references, remediation hints
  integration_points:
    - API endpoints, CLI, scheduler, bootstrap generator, webhooks

scheduler:
  responsibilities:
    - periodic artifact regeneration (default PT15M)
    - incremental generation on git push / webhook triggers
    - manage job queue with retries and exponential backoff
  policies:
    - do not replace artifact on validation failure
    - on failure: store artifact as incomplete and notify maintainers
    - admin override allowed for forced regeneration

storage:
  metadata_db:
    - Postgres (products, bootstrap_versions, validation_reports, changelog)
  artifact_store:
    - S3-compatible object store for bootstrap JSON artifacts
  backups:
    - daily DB snapshot retention 30 days
    - artifact lifecycle policy: retain 12 months (configurable)

webhooks:
  endpoints:
    - POST /webhooks/scan-result
      desc: ingest Implementor #FEEDBACK_CONTRACT
      security: HMAC signature using webhook_secret
      on_receive:
        - validate signature
        - persist feedback_contract
        - update product validation state or session_state
        - optionally trigger automated tasks (e.g., schedule re-validation)
  secret_management:
    - rotate webhook_secret monthly
    - notify maintainers on rotation

governance:
  change_management:
    - all product updates must include changelog fragment
    - breaking schema changes require RFC + two platform approvers
    - deprecation warnings published at least 3 release cycles prior
  migration_guides:
    - required for any major schema or artifact contract change
    - published under /docs/migrations/<schema>-vX-to-vY.md
  audit_logging:
    - record actor, commit_hash, diff, timestamp for writes

security:
  auth:
    - bearer token for API with RBAC
    - roles: reader, writer, ci, admin
  input_safety:
    - specs cannot contain literal secrets (validation rule)
    - redact PII in logs and validation reports
  webhook_security:
    - HMAC verification
  supply_chain:
    - dependency vulnerability scanning for guard-specs repo

observability:
  metrics:
    - product_count
    - validation_failures_total
    - bootstrap_generation_duration_seconds
    - scheduler_job_success_ratio
    - api_error_rate
  logging:
    - structured JSON logs with request_id, actor, product_id
  tracing:
    - trace bootstrap generation paths
  alerts:
    - validation_failure_spike → paging
    - scheduler_job_failure_rate > threshold → paging

testing:
  unit_tests:
    - schema validators
    - canonical serializer
    - bootstrap composer
    - auth/role enforcement
  integration_tests:
    - create product → validate → generate → fetch artifact (end-to-end)
    - webhook flow ingestion
  determinism_tests:
    - run bootstrap generation 3x with identical inputs → assert identical hashes
  e2e_tests:
    - simulate Architect session: CLI copy → Architect consumes artifact → Implementor feedback cycle
  test_data:
    - include sample product specs: simple, intermediate, complex
    - include malformed specs for negative tests

ci_cd:
  pipelines:
    - pre-commit: linters, schema validate (fast)
    - pre-merge: unit + integration + determinism tests
    - release: tag, publish openapi.yaml, run smoke tests (staging)
  releases:
    - semantic versioning
    - changelog fragment required
    - publish release notes and migration guidance for major bumps

openapi:
  file: openapi.yaml
  must_document:
    - endpoints and request/response schemas
    - auth flows and scopes
    - example requests for CLI consumption

developer_experience:
  docs:
    - getting_started.md (authoring product spec & checklist)
    - schema_guides.md (writing valid schemas)
    - bootstrap_consumer.md (how to consume artifact in Architect)
    - api_reference.md (human readable)
    - migration_guide_template.md
  cli:
    - guard-specs-cli should produce JSON suitable for Architect paste
    - include helpful error messages and remediation hints

integration_points:
  - guard-template: read shared schemas, guidance and bootstrapping patterns
  - guard-repos (concrete pillars): push audits/webhooks and retrieve artifacts
  - CI systems: call /products/{id}/validate pre-merge
  - Architect (browser): GET /products/{id}/bootstrap and paste into session

  - determinism: repeated generation of identical inputs yields identical version_hash (3x)
  - governance: schema change flow and migration guide exist for major bumps
  - security: RBAC enforced for writes; webhooks validated
  - docs: authoring guide and API reference present and verified
