short_description: >
  Free, deterministic scanner for GPU and compute waste, cost risk, and misconfiguration.
long_description: |
  ComputeScan analyzes Terraform plans and compute-heavy deployment manifests to
  detect GPU provisioning waste, incorrect instance sizing, idle or orphaned GPUs,
  and cost-risk patterns. It is deterministic, offline-capable, and designed to
  serve as the top-of-funnel scanner in the GuardSuite compute pillar.

purpose_summary: >
  Surface cost waste, risky GPU provisioning, and compute misconfiguration
  that lead to excessive cloud spend or unstable ML infrastructure.
