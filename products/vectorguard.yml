short_description: >
  Enterprise-grade governance, remediation, compliance, and GuardScore
  enhancement for vector-serving infrastructure and embedding pipelines.

long_description: |
  VectorGuard is the premium governance layer for vector-serving stacks,
  embedding pipelines, and retrieval architectures. It extends the free
  VectorScan engine with advanced rule coverage, FixPack-Lite deterministic
  remediation snippets, a full compliance ledger, premium GuardScore inputs,
  and GuardBoard-ready reporting. VectorGuard is designed for teams needing
  auditability, deterministic fixes, and enterprise security workflows in
  RAG-like vector architectures.

purpose_summary: >
  Provide deterministic enterprise governance, remediation, scoring inputs,
  and compliance visibility for vector-based infrastructure.
