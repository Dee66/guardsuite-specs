short_description: >
  Executive-grade governance dashboard aggregating GuardScore, FixPack insights,
  remediation paths, compliance ledgers, and multi-pillar risk visibility.

long_description: |
  GuardBoard is the executive-facing governance and reporting console for the
  entire GuardSuite ecosystem. It consumes deterministic outputs from VectorScan,
  ComputeScan, PipelineScan, and all paid “Guard” products to produce unified
  scorecards, trend analysis, remediation paths, and compliance-grade reports.
  GuardBoard includes GuardScore visualization, FixPack-Lite upgrade reminders,
  ledger summaries (from paid products), SVG badge distribution, and cross-pillar
  correlation for attack-path-aware insights. Designed for CISO dashboards,
  platform leadership, and compliance teams.

purpose_summary: >
  Provide a consolidated, audit-ready governance dashboard across all GuardSuite
  products, integrating GuardScore, badge issuance, FixPack summaries, and
  multi-pillar compliance signals.
