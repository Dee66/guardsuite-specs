short_description: >
  Enterprise supply-chain governance, deterministic remediation, compliance ledger,
  and premium GuardScore inputs for CI/CD workflows and artifact pipelines.

long_description: |
  PipelineGuard is the premium CI/CD and supply-chain governance blueprint for
  enterprise infrastructure and MLOps pipelines. It extends PipelineScan with
  advanced workflow-security rules, supply-chain integrity enforcement, a full
  compliance ledger, and deterministic FixPack-Lite remediation snippets. Designed
  for organizations requiring airtight workflow governance, artifact provenance,
  safe secret boundaries, and governance visibility across complex CI/CD systems.
  It integrates deeply with GuardBoard, GuardScore, and the Playground ecosystem.

purpose_summary: >
  Provide deterministic enterprise-grade governance, remediation, and compliance
  visibility for CI/CD workflows, supply-chain integrity, and pipeline security.
