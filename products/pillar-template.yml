short_description: >
  Minimal GuardSuite product scaffold that keeps doc/export pipelines satisfied
  while teams bootstrap a new pillar repository.
long_description: |
  The pillar-template product is intentionally sparse. It acts as a reference
  stub that proves the documentation, export, and validation tooling can locate
  a GuardSuite product entry even before real product content exists. Downstream
  teams can clone this YAML as a starting point and flesh out pillars, features,
  remediation metadata, and marketing copy as they mature their product.
