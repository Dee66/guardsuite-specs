short_description: >
  Minimal GuardSuite spec scaffold that keeps docs, exports, and schema
  validators satisfied while new pillar teams bootstrap content.
long_description: |
  The pillar-template blueprint acts as a deterministic starting point for any
  new GuardSuite pillar repository. It wires up the canonical schema
  structure, placeholder marketing content, empty governance sections, and
  baseline ecosystem integrations so CI pipelines stay green while teams fill
  in their details. Maintaining this template inside GuardSpecs lets Architect
  auto-create future products with zero drift.
