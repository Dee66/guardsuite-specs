short_description: >
  Hosted GuardSuite sandbox for deterministic evaluator demos, docs, and AI
  showcases.
long_description: |
  GuardSuite Playground is the browser-based evaluator environment that mirrors
  canonical GuardSuite pipelines. It runs deterministic sample plans inside a
  WASM sandbox, lets teams preview GuardScore, badge eligibility, and FixPack
  hints, and exports copyable JSON for GuardBoard or Architect. Playground keeps
  latency predictable, requires no local install, and provides shareable URLs
  for enablement and product documentation.
purpose_summary: >
  Enable zero-install GuardSuite demos with deterministic evaluator output,
  badge previews, and GuardScore insights.
