  Web-based GuardSuite sandbox that lets teams exercise canonical outputs and
  deterministic badge checks without installing the full suite.
long_description: |
  GuardSuite Playground is the hosted evaluation environment for GuardSuite
  products. It mirrors the evaluator pipeline, surfaces guardrails inside a
  browser, and ships with deterministic sample plans so contributors can preview
  badge eligibility, see FixPack snippets, and validate product metadata before
  promoting release candidates. Playground is safe to embed in docs, demos, and
  AI showcases because it avoids filesystem or network escapes and keeps latency
  predictable for WASM runtimes.
