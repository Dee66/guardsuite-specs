short_description: >
  Enterprise FinOps governance, deterministic remediation, compliance ledger,
  and premium GuardScore inputs for GPU and compute-heavy infrastructure.

long_description: |
  ComputeGuard is the premium compute governance and remediation blueprint for
  organizations operating GPU-heavy or cost-sensitive ML/AI workloads. It
  extends ComputeScan with deterministic FixPack-Lite remediation, advanced
  FinOps rule coverage, full compliance ledger generation, and GuardBoard-ready
  overlays. ComputeGuard is designed for teams requiring deep visibility into
  GPU usage, instance sizing, cost anomalies, and compute governance.

purpose_summary: >
  Provide deterministic cost governance, remediation, and compliance-level
  visibility across GPU and compute infrastructure.
