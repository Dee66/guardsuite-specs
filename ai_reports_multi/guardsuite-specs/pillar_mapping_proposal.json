    "Heuristics used: (1) presence of matching subfolder under `rule_specs/` is strongest signal; (2) presence of product directories under `products/` with typical product layout is secondary; (3) matching directory name tokens (vector/compute/pipeline) used as fallback.",
    "Candidate mappings are suggestions for where a 'pillar' could be rooted; they are not authoritative. Review by a human is recommended before structural changes.",
    "Directories like `api`, `cli`, `tools`, and `strategy_e` contain cross-cutting tooling and may house evaluator or orchestrator code rather than a single pillar — consider mapping these to a `src/<pillar>/` layout or documenting mapping in a registry.",
    "Confidence scores are conservative and intended to guide manual mapping; adjust scores if you prefer different heuristics."
