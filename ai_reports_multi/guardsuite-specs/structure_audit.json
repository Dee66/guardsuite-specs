    "The repository does not follow the Master Spec 'src/<pillar>/' layout — there is no top-level 'src' directory.",

    "No 'docs/spec.yml' file was found under 'docs/'.",
    "Unexpected_extra lists the top-level directories present in the repository (3-level scan). Many projects store pillar code under other top-level paths (e.g., 'api', 'cli'); consider mapping these to the Master Spec or adding a top-level 'src' layout.",
    "This audit is mechanical and does not modify repository files."
